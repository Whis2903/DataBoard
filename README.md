## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 16.x or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
- **Git** (optional, for cloning)

## Local Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

If using Git:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd databoard
```

Or download and extract the project files to your desired directory.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project root directory and install dependencies:

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Navigate to backend directory and install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root (if it doesn't exist) with the following configuration:

```env
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# Backend Configuration (for reference)
PORT=5000
```

**Important**: The backend server runs on port 5000, and the frontend expects the API at `http://localhost:5000/api`.

### 4. Prepare Data Files

Ensure your happiness dataset CSV files are placed in the `data/` directory. The expected files include:
- Happiness scores by country and year
- Regional classification data
- Indicator-specific datasets

### 5. Start the Backend Server

Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000`. You should see:
```
Server running on port 5000
```

### 6. Start the Frontend Development Server

Open a **new terminal** window/tab, navigate to the project root, and start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`. You should see:
```
â–² Next.js 14.x.x
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
```

### 7. Access the Dashboard

Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the Global Happiness Dashboard with multiple tabs available.

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/happiness/countries` - Get list of all countries
- `GET /api/happiness/indicators` - Get list of all indicators
- `GET /api/happiness/years` - Get available years
- `GET /api/happiness/data` - Get happiness data with optional filters
- `GET /api/happiness/regions` - Get regional data
- `GET /api/happiness/india-correlations` - Get India-specific correlations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to fetch" errors**
   - Ensure the backend server is running on port 5000
   - Check that `.env.local` has the correct API URL
   - Verify CORS settings allow localhost:3000

2. **Charts not loading**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure Plotly.js is properly installed: `npm list react-plotly.js`
   - Verify data is being fetched successfully in Network tab

3. **Backend connection issues**
   - Confirm backend server is running: check `http://localhost:5000/api/happiness/countries`
   - Ensure data files are present in the `data/` directory
   - Check backend console for error messages

4. **Port conflicts**
   - If port 3000 or 5000 is in use, update the configuration accordingly
   - Frontend: Next.js will automatically suggest alternative ports
   - Backend: Update the PORT in backend configuration and `.env.local`

### Development Tips

- Use browser Developer Tools (F12) to debug API calls and console errors
- Check the Network tab to verify API responses
- Monitor backend console for server-side errors
- Use `npm run build` to test production builds

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Plotly.js (react-plotly.js)
